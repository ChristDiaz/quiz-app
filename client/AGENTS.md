## Overview

This document outlines the AI agents integrated into the Quiz App project. Agents are defined using best practices drawn from frameworks like LangChain and AutoGPT, providing clarity and structure for interactions and responsibilities.

## Agents Defined

### 1. **QuizMaster Agent**

* **Responsibility:** Manages quiz sessions, generates questions, validates answers, and maintains the session state.
* **Inputs:** User preferences, difficulty levels, topic selections.
* **Outputs:** Quiz questions, session status, scoring updates.
* **Framework Integration:** LangChain (for conversational interaction and question management).

### 2. **QuestionGenerator Agent**

* **Responsibility:** Automatically generates quiz questions using specified topics or categories.
* **Inputs:** Topics, sub-topics, difficulty parameters.
* **Outputs:** Structured quiz questions and answers.
* **Framework Integration:** OpenAI API (GPT models), LangChain for chaining generation steps.

### 3. **Evaluator Agent**

* **Responsibility:** Evaluates user responses and determines correctness and feedback.
* **Inputs:** User's answers, correct answers, answer accuracy threshold.
* **Outputs:** Scoring feedback, explanations for correct answers.
* **Framework Integration:** LangChain (evaluation prompts), simple logic-based or semantic similarity evaluation.

### 4. **HintProvider Agent**

* **Responsibility:** Provides hints or guidance based on user's request or when they struggle.
* **Inputs:** Current question, topic context, user progress.
* **Outputs:** Contextual hints, explanatory suggestions.
* **Framework Integration:** OpenAI API (contextual embeddings and retrieval).

### 5. **Analytics Agent**

* **Responsibility:** Aggregates and analyzes user interactions and quiz results to improve quiz quality.
* **Inputs:** User session data, interaction logs.
* **Outputs:** Analytics dashboards, insights on difficulty tuning, user performance metrics.
* **Framework Integration:** Pandas for data manipulation, visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, or Plotly).

## Framework and Technology Stack

* **LangChain:** For creating modular and maintainable conversational flows and agent orchestration.
* **AutoGPT:** For automating iterative tasks and chaining generative AI outputs effectively.
* **OpenAI API:** Core AI-driven question and hint generation.
* **FastAPI/Docker:** For scalable API deployment and containerized management.

## Interaction Flow

```plaintext
User → QuizMaster → QuestionGenerator → (Question provided)
   ↓
(Evaluator assesses answers) ← User Response
   ↓
(Analytics Agent logs results and updates dashboards)
   ↓
(Optional HintProvider activated upon request)
```

## Best Practices

* Clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
* Modular and reusable code for easy agent integration.
* Efficient inter-agent communication.
* Consistent use of structured logging and analytics.

---

## Future Expansion

* Integration of advanced user profiling.
* Automated difficulty adjustment based on real-time performance.
* Community-driven question repositories.
